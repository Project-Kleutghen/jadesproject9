# What are the Hindustan Jades? #

Although jade is historically the most precious stone in Chinese culture, after the Qing empire to conquered inner Asia from 1755-1759, the Qing empire gained access to new jade forms from across the Islamic world. This included Central Asia, such as Xinjiang, Ottoman Turkey and Mughal India. Our project focuses on what Qianlong uniformly praised as the “Hindustan jades,” regardless of their actual origins. He praised them in numerous poems inspired by the objects that were incised directly onto those objects in typical Qianlong emperor fashion. 
The circulation of the jades that the Qianlong emperor possessed, and the later conceptualizations of what he believed to be the Islamic world through his poetry and collections, has significant impacts on Chinese history and geopolitical relations that remain salient in contemporary times.
