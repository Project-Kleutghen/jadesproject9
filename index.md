# Welcome #

The Qing Emperor’s Hindustan Jades integrates text analysis, mapping, and
interactive image viewers to visualize eighteenth-century China’s engagement
with the Islamic world. It was launched as an accompaniment and enhancement
of Dr. Kristina Kleutghen’s upcoming book "The Local Exotic: Fabricating Foreign Taste in Eighteenth-Century Chinese Decorative Arts". The project launched in August 2019 and is currently active.
